# Getting started

__react-fetching-library__ -  simple and powerful fetching library for React. Use hooks or HOCs to fetch data in easy way. No dependencies! Just react under the hood.

## Installation

__react-fetching-library__ requires react and react-dom version 16.8 or higher.

Run the following from your project root :

```sh
npm install react-fetching-library
```
or
```sh
yarn add react-fetching-library
```

Thatâ€™s it! You may now use __react-fetching-library__ in your React application.

## Usage

To get started you need to create an instance of [`Client`][] and then you will want to provide that client to your React component tree using the [`<ClientContextProvider/>`][] component. 

First we need an instance of [`Client`][]. We have to import `Client` function.

```js
import { Client as createClient } from 'react-fetching-library';

export const Client = createClient({
  //None option is required
  requestInterceptors: [],
  responseInterceptors: [],
  cacheProvider: cacheProvider,
});
```

Next you have to add [`<ClientContextProvider/>`][] component to the root of your React component tree. This component [provides](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) the react-fetching-library functionality to all the other components in the application without passing it explicitly. To use an [`<ClientContextProvider/>`][] with your newly constructed client see the following:

```js
import { ClientContextProvider } from 'react-fetching-library';

ReactDOM.render(
  <ClientContextProvider client={client}>
    <MyApplication />
  </ClientContextProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

From now you can add components that are connected to defined client.
